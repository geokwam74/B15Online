    Block comment , everything in between will be seen as comment
    wholes numbers  : byte, short, int, long
    fractional numbers : float, double
    logical  : boolean (true, false)
    character : char (single character in single quote)
    usually by default for whole numbers :just use int
    usually by default for fractional numbers" just use double.
    is String part of primitive types? NOO!!!!
